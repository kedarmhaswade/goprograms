// From gopl.io, Chapter 6:
// If all the methods of a named type T have a receiver type of T itself (not *T), it is safe to copy
// instances of that type; calling any of its methods necessarily makes a copy. For example, time.Duration
// values are liberally copied, including as arguments to functions. But if any method has a pointer receiver,
// you should avoid copying instances of T because doing so may violate internal invariants.
// For example, copying an instance of bytes.Buffer would cause the original and the copy to alias (ยง2.3.2)
// the same underlying array of bytes. Subsequent method calls would have unpredictable effects.
// Can we demonstrate that?

// Let's try creating a type T and two methods, one that works on T and other on *T and see if
// an inconsistency can be produced rather easily.
